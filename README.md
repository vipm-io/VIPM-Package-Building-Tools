# VIPM Package Building Tools

This package contains some tools useful for package builders.

## Status

This tool is currently under development and is not yet available on vipm.io.

## Overview

For example, you can unpack and repack a package file, performing useful operations like what's shown below (in this case, setting a package's MNU file to synchronize with a specific directory) that are not directly supported by the high level VIPM Package Builder GUI.
